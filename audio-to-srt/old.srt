Hey everyone, my name is Pete Cheslock and I'm here to share with you our latest feature

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,960
in the AppMap extension for JetBrains users, Code Accurate Automatic Sequence Diagrams.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,960
After installing the AppMap plugin to your Spring Java project, select on the Run with

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,780
AppMap icon to start your application with AppMap enabled.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,600
After your application is running, you can create a new remote recording of an interaction.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,920
Click the record button and enter in the URL for your application to start recording.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,000
Now interact with your application in any way that you're trying to better understand.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,080
When finished, click Stop Recording and name your AppMap.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,120
You can now open your AppMap, which will default to Dependency View.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
Then click over to the new Sequence Diagram view, where you can see all the interactions

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
from API to Database, and directly link to any of the code involved in your request.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,160
You can get started now by downloading AppMap at appmap.io or inside your JetBrains Marketplace.
